## Course work


### The physics of phenology

- Convert the established relationship between altitude and phenology to one which includes temperature
  - i.e. provide an estimate on how many days phenology changes per degrees Celsius change.

### Temporal / Spatial anomalies

For a location centered on the Adirondacks in the Eastern US calculate:

- Start of season phenology for thresholds of respectively 25 and 85% amplitude for years 2001 - 2010
- Only consider deciduous broadleaf or mixed forest pixels
- calculate a long term mean and standard deviation for the period 2001 - 2009 in the green-up time (time between 25% - 85% amplitude)
- calculate the difference between the long term mean and 2010
  - how different are the results from the previous decade, and could you explain differences if any?

### Scaling, from pixels to the globe (just more pixels)

- download /use MODIS CMG data (climate model grid at 5 km)
  - downloaded from the LP DAAC (might provide the data - although it would be a good exercise in data acquisition)
- apply the algorithm to the globe
- assess the performance and consistency across the globe
  - where does it fail?
  - how does it fail?
  - can you address it?
