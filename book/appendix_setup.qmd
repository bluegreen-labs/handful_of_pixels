## Required packages

To run this course a set of R packages is required. The below script lets you quickly install all of them, in the correct order.


```{r eval = FALSE}
# Windows is sensitive to the order of installation
# of some of the packages so follow this order 
# as noted below, on other systems this might be
# less of an issue but follow the instructions
# regardless

# First install the rlang packages which provides
# R functionalities needed by/for other packages
# in particular dplyr 
install.packages("rlang")

# next install dplyr needed to manipulate
# tidy data as discussed in the R crash course
install.packages("dplyr")

# for convenient plotting we also install
# ggplot2 (this is not required but most plots shown
# are generated using ggplot)
install.packages("ggplot2")

# to deal with relative paths in R markdown
# install the here package
install.packages("here")

# next up are the installs of the geospatial
# libraries, these can be installed in one
# go
install.packages(c("terra","tidyterra","sf","MODISTools"))
```
