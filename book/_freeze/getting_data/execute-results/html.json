However, how to efficiently access these data sources is a skill in its own right. \n\nIn general you have to know:\n\n- where to find data, what are common sources\n- how to download the data\n- how to read in the data once downloaded\n- how to interpret the data (domain knowledge)\n\n## Finding open trustworthy data\n\nEnvironmental data can be found in a number of locations and a general web search will point you to them if you know the name of a data set you have in mind. If you want to broaden your search into new data products the best sources are often **governmental organizations**. Governments collect and sponsor data acquisition and retention, with various administrations focusing on on particular topics, e.g. remote sensing, forestry, population statistics. For example, if you are looking for satellite remote sensing data it makes sense to look at for example the **[European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int/)** data repositories or the United States **[National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)](https://www.nasa.gov/)**. If you are looking for spatially explicit **population statistics [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat)** might be a good starting place to start your search. Most states keep inventories of their protected areas as well as detailed forest inventories. Similarly, weather agencies on a state or European level can provide wealth of data. Directing your searches toward state level agencies will land you with reliable sources of data.\n\nSimilarly, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), foundations and other non-profit organizations can be a valuable source of information. General street layouts, and **location based information on businesses and other venues** can be sourced from **Open Street Map (OSM)**. The World Wild Fund (WWF) has contributed to biodiversity mapping initiatives. In general, non-profits and NGOs are trustworthy but in an age of disinformation and shadow lobbying you should verify if sources are common within scientific literature.nodo\n\nScientific literature can also be a valuable source of data products. However, finding these data products is often difficult as they are not necessarily centralized in a structured way or they might not even be shared publicly. Centralized repositories do exist. Noteworthy are **Zenodo**, an data repository for research data supported by CERN but holding vast stores of data on a variety of research topics. Similarly **Dryad and Figshare** provide long term storage of published research data.\n\nBelow you find a list of useful data sources:\n\n- [ECMWFR Copernicus Data Services](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) (climate data)\n- [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) (access to the Sentinel remote sensing data)\n- [EOSDIS Digital Active Archive Centers](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs)  (DAACs)\n- [Integrated Carbon Observation System](https://www.icos-cp.eu/about/icos-in-nutshell) (ICOS)\n- [National Ecosystem Observation Network](https://www.neonscience.org/) (NEON)\n- Scientific data repositories (open data downloads or deposits)\n  - [Zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org)\n  - [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash) \n  - [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) \n\nThis list is not extensive and many other sources exist. However, I will source mostly from these data sources in the book. Some familiarity with the names of these data sources is therefore helpful.\n\n## A handfull of pixels\n\nThe sections above assume that you have inherited some data from someone, or have data files on disk (in a particular format). Yet, most of the time, gathering data is the first step in any analysis. Depending on where data is hosted you can simply download data through your web browser or use the internal `download.file()` R function to grab data.\n\nToday, many of the data described in previous sections are warehoused in large cloud facilities. These data (and their underlying data formats) are stored in large databases and displayed through various applications. For example, Google Maps displays remote sensing (satellite) raster image data in addition to street level vector based labels. These services allow you to access the underlying (original) data using an API, hence programmatically using code. Mastering the use of these services has become key in gathering research data.\n\n\n#### Direct downloads\n\nBefore diving into a description of APIs, we remind you that some file reading functions in R are web-aware, and can not only read local files but also remote ones (i.e., URLs). Getting ahead of ourselves a bit (see tutorials below), the example code shows you how to read the content of a URL directly into your R environment.\n\nAlthough using this functionality isn't equivalent to using an API, the concept is the same. I.e., you load a remote data source.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# define a URL with data of interest\n# in this case annual mean CO2 levels at Mauna Loa\nurl <- \"https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_annmean_mlo.csv\"\n\n# read in the data directly from URL\ndf <- read.table(\n  url,\n  header = TRUE,\n  sep = \",\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### APIs\n\nWeb-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offer a way to specify the scope of the returned data, and ultimately, the processing which goes on behind the scene in response to a (data) query. APIs are a way to, in a limited way, control a remote server to execute a certain (data) action. In most (RESTful) APIs, such query takes the form of an HTTP URL via an URL-encoded scheme using an API endpoint (or base URL).\n\nTo reduce some of the complexity of APIs, it is common that a wrapper is written around an API in the language of choice (e.g., R, Python). These dedicated API libraries make it easier to access data and limit coding overhead.\n\n##### Dedicated API libraries {.unnumbered}\n\nAs an example of a dedicated library, we use the [{MODISTools} R package](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs/MODISTools) which queries remote sensing data generated by the MODIS remote sensing (satellite) mission from the Oak Ridge National Laboratories data archive.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load the library\nlibrary(\"MODISTools\")\n\n# list all available products\nproducts <- MODISTools::mt_products()\n\n# print the first few lines\n# of available products\nprint(head(products))\n\n# download a demo dataset\n# specifying a location, a product,\n# a band (subset of the product)\n# and a date range and a geographic\n# area (1 km above/below and left/right).\n# Data is returned internally and the\n# progress bar of the download is not shown.\nsubset <- MODISTools::mt_subset(\n  product = \"MOD11A2\",\n  lat = 40,\n  lon = -110,\n  band = \"LST_Day_1km\",\n  start = \"2004-01-01\",\n  end = \"2004-02-01\",\n  km_lr = 1,\n  km_ab = 1,\n  internal = TRUE,\n  progress = FALSE\n)\n\n# print the dowloaded data\nprint(head(subset))\n```\n:::\n\n\nA detailed description of all functions of the {MODISTools} R package is beyond the scope of this course. However, the listed command show you what a dedicated API package does. It is a shortcut to functional elements of an API. For example `mt_products()` allows you to quickly list all products without any knowledge of an API URL. Although more complex, as requiring parameters, the `mt_subset()` routine allows you to query remote sensing data for a single location (specified with a latitude `lat` and longitude `lon`), and a given date range (e.g., start, end parameters), a physical extent (in km left-right and above-below).\n\n##### GET {.unnumbered}\n\nDepending on your data source, you will either need to rely on a dedicated R package to query the API or study the API documentation. The general scheme for using an API follows the use of the `GET()` command of the {httr} R library. You define a query using API parameters, as a named list, and then use a `GET()` statement to download the data from the endpoint (`url`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# formulate a named list query to pass to httr\nquery <- list(\n  \"argument\" = \"2\",\n  \"another_argument\" = \"3\"\n)\n\n# The URL of the API (varies per product / param)\nurl <- \"https://your.service.endpoint.com\"\n\n# download data using the\n# API endpoint and query data\n# status variable will include if\n# the download was successful or not\n# the write_disk() function captures\n# data if available and writes it to\n# disk\nstatus <- httr::GET(\n  url = url,\n  query = query,\n  httr::write_disk(\n    path = \"/where/to/store/data/filename.ext\",\n    overwrite = TRUE\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nBelow, we provide an example of using the `GET` command to download data from the [Regridded Harmonized World Soil Database (v1.2)](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1247) as hosted on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory computer infrastructure. In this case we download a subset of a global map of topsoil sand content (`T_SAND`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set API URL endpoint\n# for the total sand content\nurl <- \"https://thredds.daac.ornl.gov/thredds/ncss/ornldaac/1247/T_SAND.nc4\"\n\n# formulate query to pass to httr\nquery <- list(\n  \"var\" = \"T_SAND\",\n  \"south\" = 32,\n  \"west\" = -81,\n  \"east\" = -80,\n  \"north\" = 34,\n  \"disableProjSubset\" = \"on\",\n  \"horizStride\" = 1,\n  \"accept\" = \"netcdf4\"\n)\n\n# download data using the\n# API endpoint and query data\nstatus <- httr::GET(\n  url = url,\n  query = query,\n  httr::write_disk(\n    path = file.path(tempdir(), \"T_SAND.nc\"),\n    overwrite = TRUE\n  )\n)\n\n# to visualize the data\n# we need to load the {terra}\n# library\nlibrary(\"terra\")\nsand <- terra::rast(file.path(tempdir(), \"T_SAND.nc\"))\nterra::plot(sand)\n```\n:::\n\n\n##### Authentication {.unnumbered}\n\nDepending on the API, authentication using a user name and a key or password is required. Then, the template should be slightly altered to accommodate for these requirements. Note that instead of the `GET()` command we use `POST()` as we need to post some authentication data before we can get the data in return.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# an authenticated API query\nstatus <- httr::POST(\n  url = url,\n  httr::authenticate(user, key),\n  httr::add_headers(\"Accept\" = \"application/json\",\n                    \"Content-Type\" = \"application/json\"),\n  body = query,\n  encode = \"json\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Download basic MODIS dataset, this should be pre-downloaded\n# as the ORNL DAAC can be horrendously slow.\n#\n# Students should initiate the download but probably will realize\n# that it will take too long, we need to offer a fix if they\n# want to proceed quickly\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(geodata)\n\n# download SRTM data\nif (!file.exists(\"data-raw/srtm_38_03.tif\")){\n  geodata::elevation_3s(\n    lat = 46.6756,\n    lon = 7.85480,\n    path = \"data-raw/\"\n  )\n}\n\n# post processing for lessons\n\nphenology <- readRDS(\"data/phenology_2012.rds\")\nphenology <- phenology |>\n  mutate(\n    value = ifelse(value > 32656, NA, value),\n    value = format(as.Date(\"1970-01-01\") + value, \"%j\")\n  )\nphenology_raster <- mt_to_terra(phenology, reproject = TRUE)\n\n# crop the dem\ndem <- terra::crop(\n  x = dem,\n  y = phenology_raster\n)\n\n# resample the dem\ndem <- terra::resample(\n  x = dem,\n  y = phenology_raster\n)\n\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(MODISTools)\nlibrary(terra)\n\n# download and save phenology data\nphenology_2012 <- mt_subset(\n  product = \"MCD12Q2\",\n  lat = 46.6756,\n  lon = 7.85480,\n  band = \"Greenup.Num_Modes_01\",\n  start = \"2012-01-01\",\n  end = \"2012-12-31\",\n  km_lr = 100,\n  km_ab = 100,\n  site_name = \"swiss\",\n  internal = TRUE,\n  progress = FALSE\n)\n\nsaveRDS(\n  phenology_2012,\n  \"data/phenology_2012.rds\",\n  compress = \"xz\"\n)\n\n# download and save land cover data\nland_cover_2012 <- mt_subset(\n  product = \"MCD12Q1\",\n  lat = 46.6756,\n  lon = 7.85480,\n  band = \"LC_Type1\",\n  start = \"2012-01-01\",\n  end = \"2012-12-31\",\n  km_lr = 100,\n  km_ab = 100,\n  site_name = \"swiss\",\n  internal = TRUE,\n  progress = FALSE\n)\n\nsaveRDS(\n  land_cover_2012,\n  \"data/land-cover_2012.rds\",\n  compress = \"xz\"\n)\n\n# download LAI data\nlai_2012 <- mt_subset(\n  product = \"MCD15A3H\",\n  lat = 46.6756,\n  lon = 7.85480,\n  band = c(\"Lai_500m\",\"FparLai_QC\"),\n  start = \"2012-01-01\",\n  end = \"2012-12-31\",\n  km_lr = 100,\n  km_ab = 100,\n  site_name = \"swiss\",\n  internal = TRUE,\n  progress = TRUE\n)\n\nsaveRDS(\n  lai_2012,\n  \"data/lai_2012.rds\",\n  compress = \"xz\"\n)\n\nmessage(\"all done...\")\n```\n:::",
