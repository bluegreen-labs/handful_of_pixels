# Basics of Remote Sensing {#sec-basic-rs}

This section will cover some of the basics of remote sensing in the visible
and infrared spectral domain in order to provide you with a good understanding
of concepts introduced in @sec-phenology-trends, and @sec-land-cover. I will not
cover radar based remote sensing as out of scope within the context of this book
and the examples provided. For an introduction of radar remote sensing I refer
to XYZ.

Many of these principles scale from leaf to globe, ranging from field spectroscopy,
over tower based measurements such as [PhenoCams](phenocam.nau.edu) and 
[SpecNet](https://specnet.info/) hyperspectral sensors, over UAVs, airplane based measurements all
the way to satellite remote sensing platforms.

This -very- brief introduction should provide you with a basic understanding of
how remote sensing works, the origin of some of the terminology and how this
relates to worked examples and provided data.

## The electromagnetic spectrum

Basic physics dictates that a [(black) body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation) 
in thermal equilibrium emits radiation
with a spectrum (intensity distribution) determined by [Planck's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law), i.e. 
determined only by it's temperature. This spectrum covers a range of states 
ranging form shortwave high energy radiation to long wave radio waves.

Stars in particular can be idealized as black bodies and own Sun - which 
radiates at ~5780K - has its own particular spectrum  @fig-solar-radiation. 
The internal state of the  Sun further determines some of the peculiarities 
in this spectrum.

How much radiation is emmitted is dependent on the internal nuclear physics,
as well as the absorption bands which "drop" out.

Check the basis of SIF measurements, solar induced.


Given that in the visible and infrared part of the spectrum (almost all) 
radiation is inherently originating from our own Sun. This makes that the Sun
signal forms a reference, while other interfering factors are external to it.

These external factors, and the way in which the earth surface, water or plants
react with this incoming radiation determines the scope and applications of
remote sensing.

#| fig-cap: "This figure shows the solar radiation spectrum for direct light at both the top of the Earth's atmosphere (represented by the area in yellow) and at sea level (area in red). The sun produces light with a distribution similar to what would be expected from a 5525 K (5250 Â°C) blackbody, which is approximately the sun's surface temperature. As light passes through the atmosphere, some is absorbed by gases with specific absorption bands. Additional light is redistributed by Rayleigh scattering, which is responsible for the atmosphere's blue color. These curves are based on NREL data for above the atmosphere and at sea level, which are standards adopted by the photovoltaics industry to ensure consistent test conditions and are similar to the light that could be expected in North America. Regions for ultraviolet, visible and infrared light are indicated. by [Robert A. Rohde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dragons_flight)"

Some of the characteristic Fraunhofer lines and their corresponding elements are indicated for the extended visible spectrum (highlighted area in the graph). For photometry and colorimetry, standard measurements are usually carried out in the range 360 - 830 nm. From these data and for this spectral range, the correlated color temperature (CCT) is 5470 K. by [Cyamahat](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Cyamahat)"

We detect the interactions of the earth with the incoming solar radiation.

How we perceive the world is determined by the visible electro-magenetic spectrum.

## A band-aid

The lack of measurements of the full spectrum (VIS/NIR) is in part due to the 
limitation of remote sensing platforms, or the receiving stations and processing
capabilities.

In remote sensing there is a spatio-temporal-spectral trade-off, where resolution
in the spatial and temporal domain can be traded for more spectral information.
However, what mostly happens is that distinct features / bands are chosen based
upon well known characteristics of a number of broad processes of interest.

For example.. MODIS vs. Sentinel-2

This selection of specific bands is a trade-off or band-aid, and an ideal system
would cover a high spatial, temporal and spectral domain.
