For many this might seem an odd choice but contrary to common believes R does provide solid geospatial frameworks. These frameworks provide all the tools you need for small and larger geospatial projects.\nIn this book I will focus on a set of examples which are rather limited in scope, using just a handfull of pixels.Not only does this allow you to experiment with geospatial data on limited compute infrastructure, it also shows you that true science can be done with relatively modest means. In many ways this logic runs counter to the current practices either moving analysis to the cloud and/or trying to provide wall-to-wall (global) coverage irrespective of the added value to a study.\nTO INCLUDE:\n\nfurthermore note that much validation data is still only available as point data (although some of this is changing within the context of the merger of computer vission with remote sensing)\nit also limits data management (which is also resolved by cloud platforms and bringing compute towards managed datasets)\n\nThe goal of this book is therefore not to teach you a particular set of (industry) tools, but rather a balanced combination of both open source (R based) tools and a focus on conceptual development for rapid prototyping of research ideas within R. This book is in many ways an extension of Geocomputation with R by Lovelace, Nowosad, Muenchow. For strict geocomputational knowledge I refer to this source. Although the book uses R the methods described are rather environment agnostic and a similar work could be created for the python language. Where possible I will point to such alternatives.\nThis book requires prior knowledge of programming in R, git and cloud based collaborative tools such as Github. However, to refresh some concepts, or for those who want to skip ahead, I will repeat some basic skills at the beginning of the book to get you started."

The smallest unit in a reproducible workflow is the structure of your personal research project (irrespective of its contributions to a larger whole). Structuring a research project.\nStructuring your project covers:\n\nthe organization of your files (i.e. code, data, manuscripts)\nfile naming conventions (how things are named)\ncode documentation (describing what and how you do things)\ndata documentation (describing data sources)\nversion control (logging progress systematically)\n\nWhen using R the easiest solution to many of these issues is to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE, e.g. RStudio or VS Code), version control to track code changes such as git and its cloud based collaborative components such as Github or Codeberg. The setup of both IDEs is described in Appendix A.\nIt is recommended to start a new project in the RStudio IDE and provide a consistent structure grouping similar objects in folders, e.g. storing data in a data folder, your R scripts in the R folder etc. You can further select the tracking of used packages using renv when creating a new project.\n\nproject/\n├─ your_project.Rproj\n├─ vignettes/\n│  ├─ your_dynamic_document.Rmd\n├─ data/\n│  ├─ some_data.csv\n├─ R/\n│  ├─ R_scripts.R\n\nFor those familiar with github I provide a Github template which you can use when creating a new project on Github.

    "section": "1.2 Basic R",
    "text": "1.2 Basic R\nUnlike many other frameworks for geocomputation, and in particular graphical geographic information system (GIS) such as ArcGIS and QGIS, geocomputation in R is uniquely code oriented. Some basic knowledge of data types, code structure and execution is therefore required. Below I give a very very short introduction to the most basic principles. For an in depth discussion on all these aspects I refer to the resources mentioned at the top of this section.\n\n1.2.1 Data types\nWithin R common data structures are vectors, list objects and data frames and tibbles, which are defined as such:\n\n# A numeric vector\nv <- c(1,4,5,6)\n\n# A named list\nl <- list(\n  element_a = \"a\",\n  number_2 = 2\n)\n\n# A data frame (or structured named lists)\ndf <- data.frame(\n  numbers = c(1,3,2),\n  letters = c(\"a\", \"b\",\"c\")\n)\n\nNote that in R variables are assigned using the <- (left arrow), however you can use = as well (which is more in line with for example python). Once assigned these elements are available for recall (from memory) an can be used for computation, or other operations. For example we can print the list using:\n\nprint(l)\n\n$element_a\n[1] \"a\"\n\n$number_2\n[1] 2\n\n\nData frames in this context represent tabulated data where the content can vary by column.\n\nprint(df)\n\n  numbers letters\n1       1       a\n2       3       b\n3       2       c\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Sub-setting and type conversions\nYou can access data in the above data types by referring to them by index, or in some cases by name. For example, accessing the 2th element in vector v can be accomplished by using v[2]. Element ‘a’ in list l can be accessed using:\n\nv[2]\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nNamed list or data frame elements can be accessed using their respective names and the dollar sign ($) notation using the following syntax variable + $ + element or column, e.g. :\n\n# access a named list element\nl$number_2\n\n[1] 2\n\n# access a data frame column\ndf$letters\n\n[1] \"a\" \"b\" \"c\"\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Basic math & operations\nAll variables are available for mathematical operations using built in functions or basic mathematical operators (+, -, *, /):\n\n# multiplying/dividing the number vector n\nv * 2\n\n[1]  2  8 10 12\n\n# dividing the number vector n\nv / 2\n\n[1] 0.5 2.0 2.5 3.0\n\n# adding a value to number vector n\nv + 2\n\n[1] 3 6 7 8\n\n# subtracting a value to number vector n\nv - 2\n\n[1] -1  2  3  4\n\n\nNote that these operations are applied to all elements of a vector (or column of a dataframe) when called without specifying a particular subset. This sweeping computation of a whole set of data is called vectorization and can be used to greatly increase computational speed by limiting the need to loop over individual variables explicitly.\nR comes with a large library of functions. A function is a pre-assigned operation which is executed on the desired variable. An example of which is the cumsum() function which calculates the cumulative sum of consecutive elements in a vector / data frame column.\n\n# calculating a cummulative sum of number vector n\ncumsum(v)\n\n[1]  1  5 10 16\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Functions (custom)\nIn addition to the included functions you can write your own functions in R. This allows you to automate certain routine operations particular to your project / setting.\nFor example, one can define a small function which reports back the last element of a vector:\n\n# defines a function printing\n# the last element of a vector\nlast <- function(x) {\n  x[length(x)]\n}\n\nExecuting this on our vector v, will show the following result:\n\n# apply the defined function\nlast(v)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nBe mindful of the breath of included functions in R or currently available packages. For example, within the dplyr package, which provides common data manipulation functionality, there is a function called last(). For the use of libraries see Section 1.3.\n\n\n1.2.5 Reading data\nIn the above examples I have shown only simple examples relying on internal data. However, different functions exist to read external data into R. The most basic function to read human readable (text) data into R is read.table(). Below I use a combination of write.table() and read.table() to demonstrate how to write human readable (text) data to file, and read the data back in.\n\n# create a data frame with demo data\ndf_original <- data.frame(\n  col_1 = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"),\n  col_2 = c(\"d\", \"e\", \"f\"),\n  col_3 = c(1,2,3)\n)\n\n# write table as CSV to disk\nwrite.table(\n  x = df_original,\n  file = file.path(tempdir(), \"your_file.csv\"),\n  sep = \",\",\n  row.names = FALSE\n)\n\n# Read a CSV file\ndf <- read.table(\n  file.path(tempdir(), \"your_file.csv\"),\n  header = TRUE,\n  sep = \",\",\n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n)\n\nAll digital data which is not represented as text characters can be considered binary data. One of the advantages of binary data is that it is an efficient representation of data, saving space. This comes at the cost of requiring a dedicated software (i.e. libraries), other than a text editor, to manipulate the data.\nIn geography and environmental sciences particular (geospatial) file formats dominate the field. Some of these file formats relate to the content of the data, some of these formats are legacy formats due to the history of the field itself. Below you find a list some of the most common formats you will encounter. For the use of libraries I refer to Section 1.3 and REFERENCE GEOSPATIAL DATA CHAPTER.\n\n\n\nFile format (extension)\nFormat description\nUse case\nR Library\n\n\n\n\n*.csv\ncomma separated tabular data\nGeneral purpose flat files with row and column oriented data\nbase R\n\n\n*.txt\ntabular data with various delimiters\nGeneral purpose flat files with row and column oriented data\nbase R\n\n\n*.json\nstructured human-readable data\nGeneral purpose data format.

    "text": "1.3 Libraries / packages\nNot all software components are included in a basic R installation. Additional components can be installed as libraries or packages from official R archives (CRAN), or github (see below). A full list of packages used in the rendering of the book and its examples can be found in Appendix C, where information on the automated installation of all required packages is provided in Appendix A.\nFor example, we can extend the capabilities of base R by installing the dplyr package from the official CRAN archive using: install.pacakges(\"dplyr\"). dplyr provides a set of functions to facilitate common data manipulation challenges covered in Section 1.4. After a successful installation you can load packages using the library() function, as library(\"dplyr\"). Functions as defined within dplyr can then be accessed in scripts or from the command line.\n\n# load the library\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# show the first element of the vector\nfirst(v)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nAt times it can be useful to use the :: notation in calling package functions. The :: notation allows you to call a function without loading the full package using library(). This can be done useful if you only need one particular function, and don’t want to load the whole package (as this might have memory/performance implications). Furthermore, the use of :: makes it explicit what the source package of a particular function is. This can be helpful if packages have functions with the same name, leading to confusion on the source of the function used.\n\n# show the last element of the vector v\n# using the dplyr version of \"last\"\n# calling the function explicitly\n# avoiding confusion with our own\n# last() function\ndplyr::last(v)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\nExternal packages (non CRAN)\nFor installs from external sources we need the remotes package. Installing a package directly from a Github location would then be possible using for example:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"tidyverse/dplyr\")\n\nThis command loads the latest development version of dplyr from its Github location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that packages on Github or elsewhere are note reviewed, and might pose security risks to your system."

    "section": "1.4 Tidy data",
    "text": "1.4 Tidy data\nThroughout the book I will structure data using a tidy data approach. Tidy data is a way of structuring data where every row represents a single sample and every row represents a single variable. The tidy data format is a long row orientated format. In short, in tidy data:\n\nevery column is a variable\nevery row is an observation\nevery cell is a single value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Image by Posit Software, PBC (posit.co)\n\n\n\n\nThis format allows for easier grouped operations. As visually illustrated below, filtering data by observation properties is easier when data is rowwise oriented (Figure 1.2).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Image by Posit Software, PBC (posit.co)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAny other configuration is considered “messy data”, but therefore not invalid or “bad”. Certain messy data formats might be more memory efficient.\n\n\n\n1.4.1 Tidy data conversions\nAlthough both long or wide data formats have their advantages and drawbacks, the use of long (row oriented) data allows us to use the dplyr library to iterate over data quickly and transparently (see Figure 1.2). However, large amounts of data are provided as “messy data” which is not rowwise oriented. An understanding of conversions from a wide to a long data format are therefore critical throughout this manual.\nTo convert the below “messy” data frame listing “cases” by year for three countries to a long format you can use the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr library. The tidyr library contains a set of tools for the conversion to and cleaning of data into a tidy (not messy) data format.\n\n# demo data frame with \"cases\" for\n# three countries, where the cases\n# are listed by year in a columnn by\n# column basis\ndf <- data.frame(\n  country = c(\"CH\",\"BE\",\"FR\"),\n  year_2000 = c(200, 40, 1340),\n  year_2001 = c(21, 56, 5940)\n)\n\nhead(df)\n\n  country year_2000 year_2001\n1      CH       200        21\n2      BE        40        56\n3      FR      1340      5940\n\n\nThe conversion of the data looks like this, ordering the data with the yearly columns ordered in a single “year” column, the containig data in a column called “cases”. Values are taken from columns (cols) which start with “year”. Alternatively you could provide and vector with column names or column indices.\n\ntidy_df <- tidyr::pivot_longer(\n  df,\n  cols = starts_with(\"year\"),\n  names_to = \"year\",\n  values_to = \"cases\"\n)\n\nhead(tidy_df)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  country year      cases\n  <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>\n1 CH      year_2000   200\n2 CH      year_2001    21\n3 BE      year_2000    40\n4 BE      year_2001    56\n5 FR      year_2000  1340\n6 FR      year_2001  5940\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Tidy data manipulations\n\nPiping data\nWhen using dplyr and tidyr libraries we can make use of the pipe concept. A pipe is a way to forward the output of one function to the input of the next, stringing together an analysis as you would read a sentence. Throughout this manuscript the native pipe (|>) is used. Rewriting the previous pivot_longer() operation would yield:\n\ntidy_df <- df |>\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(\n  cols = starts_with(\"year\"),\n  names_to = \"year\",\n  values_to = \"cases\"\n)\n\nhead(tidy_df)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  country year      cases\n  <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>\n1 CH      year_2000   200\n2 CH      year_2001    21\n3 BE      year_2000    40\n4 BE      year_2001    56\n5 FR      year_2000  1340\n6 FR      year_2001  5940\n\n\nHere the data frame df has it’s output forwarded (|>) to the function pivot_longer(), which will process the data according to the parameters specified. Note that the data frame is not explicitly called by the pivot_longer() function itself.\n\n\nFiltering data\nTidy data is especially convenient when filtering and selecting data. When filtering data you apply criteria rowwise using the dplyr::filter() function. For example we can filter out data based upon “year” or “cases” in our tidy_df.\n\n# filter data for year_2000\n# with more than 50 cases\ntidy_df |>\n  dplyr::filter(\n    year == \"year_2000\",\n    cases > 50\n  ) |>\n  print()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  country year      cases\n  <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>\n1 CH      year_2000   200\n2 FR      year_2000  1340\n\n\nFiltering thus reduces the number of rows in your dataset. This can be visually represented as such (Figure 3.1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Image by Posit Software, PBC (posit.co)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting data\nSelecting data operates on columns instead of rows. You can select columns using the dplyr::select() function. For example, when selecting only the country code and cases counted:\n\n# only retain the country code\n# and case numbers\ntidy_df |>\n  dplyr::select(\n    country,\n    cases\n  ) |>\n  print()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  country cases\n  <chr>   <dbl>\n1 CH        200\n2 CH         21\n3 BE         40\n4 BE         56\n5 FR       1340\n6 FR       5940\n\n\nThe output therefore has the same number of rows, but only outputs the selected columns.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Image by Posit Software, PBC (posit.co)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutate & summarize\nThe tidy logic allows for easy conversions or reduction of column data using the dplyr::mutate() and dplyr::summarize() functions respectively. For example we can double the case count values using:\n\ntidy_df |>\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    caces_2x = cases * 2\n  ) |>\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  country year      cases caces_2x\n  <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 CH      year_2000   200      400\n2 CH      year_2001    21       42\n3 BE      year_2000    40       80\n4 BE      year_2001    56      112\n5 FR      year_2000  1340     2680\n6 FR      year_2001  5940    11880\n\n\nSimilarly we can calculate the mean case count across all the available data as:\n\ntidy_df |>\n  dplyr::summarize(\n    mean_cases = mean(cases)\n  ) |>\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  mean_cases\n       <dbl>\n1      1266.\n\n\n\n\nGrouped operations\nFinally, we can apply the dplyr::mutate() and dplyr::summarize() functions across groups, defined by an index, using the dplyr::group_by() function. For example we can calculate the mean case count per year as follows:\n\ntidy_df |>\n  group_by(year) |>\n  dplyr::summarize(\n    mean_cases = mean(cases)\n  ) |>\n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  year      mean_cases\n  <chr>          <dbl>\n1 year_2000       527.\n2 year_2001      2006.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Image by Posit Software, PBC (posit.co)\n\n\n\n\nGrouped operations using dplyr::mutate() and dplyr::summarize() and other functions highlighted cover a substantial fraction of day-to-day data wrangling."

If you want to broaden your search into new data products the best sources are often governmental organizations. Governments collect and sponsor data acquisition and retention, with various administrations focusing on on particular topics, e.g. remote sensing, forestry, population statistics. For example, if you are looking for satellite remote sensing data it makes sense to look at for example the European Space Agency (ESA) data repositories or the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). If you are looking for spatially explicit population statistics Eurostat might be a good starting place to start your search. Most states keep inventories of their protected areas as well as detailed forest inventories. Similarly, weather agencies on a state or European level can provide wealth of data. Directing your searches toward state level agencies will land you with reliable sources of data.\nSimilarly, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), foundations and other non-profit organizations can be a valuable source of information. General street layouts, and location based information on businesses and other venues can be sourced from Open Street Map (OSM). The World Wild Fund (WWF) has contributed to biodiversity mapping initiatives. In general, non-profits and NGOs are trustworthy but in an age of disinformation and shadow lobbying you should verify if sources are common within scientific literature.nodo\nScientific literature can also be a valuable source of data products. However, finding these data products is often difficult as they are not necessarily centralized in a structured way or they might not even be shared publicly. Centralized repositories do exist. Noteworthy are Zenodo, an data repository for research data supported by CERN but holding vast stores of data on a variety of research topics. Similarly Dryad and Figshare provide long term storage of published research data.\nBelow you find a list of useful data sources:\n\nECMWFR Copernicus Data Services (climate data)\nCopernicus Open Access Hub (access to the Sentinel remote sensing data)\nEOSDIS Digital Active Archive Centers (DAACs)\nIntegrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS)\nNational Ecosystem Observation Network (NEON)\nScientific data repositories (open data downloads or deposits)\n\nZenodo.org\nDryad\nFigshare\n\n\nThis list is not extensive and many other sources exist. However, I will source mostly from these data sources in the book. Some familiarity with the names of these data sources is therefore helpful. Depending on where data is hosted you can simply download data through your web browser or use the internal download.file() function to grab data to store it locally.\n\n# Downloading a time series of mean CO2 levels from NOAA\n# and storing it in a temporary file\nurl <- \"https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_annmean_mlo.csv\"\n\ndownload.file(\n  url,\n  file.path(tempdir(), \"co2.csv\")\n)"

    "text": "2.2 Gathering a handfull of pixels\nThe sections above (Section 2.1) assume that you download data locally, on disk in a particular format. However, many of the data sources described in previous section are warehoused in large cloud facilities. These services allow you to access the underlying (original) data using an Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), hence programmatically, using code. Mastering the use of these services has become key in gathering research data sets. Given the scope of this book I will focus on ways to gather small approximately analysis ready geospatial datasets using APIs.\n\n2.2.1 Direct downloads\nBefore diving into a description of APIs, I remind you that some file reading functions in R are “web-enabled”, and can not only read local files but also remote ones (i.e., URLs). Getting ahead of ourselves a bit, the example code shows you how to read the content of a URL (of CO2 data) directly into your R environment.\nAlthough using this functionality isn’t equivalent to using an API, the concept is the same. I.e., you load a remote data source (albeit without further subsetting or passing of any parameters).\n\n# read in the data directly from URL\ndf <- read.table(\n  url,\n  header = TRUE,\n  sep = \",\"\n)\n\n\n\n2.2.2 APIs\nWeb-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) offer a way to specify the scope of the returned data, and ultimately, the processing which goes on behind the scene in response to a (data) query. APIs are a way to, in a limited way, control a remote server to execute a certain (data) action. In most (RESTful) APIs, such query takes the form of an HTTP URL via an URL-encoded scheme using an API endpoint (or base URL).\nTo reduce some of the complexity of APIs, it is common that a wrapper is written around an API in the language of choice (e.g., R, Python). These dedicated API libraries make it easier to access data and limit coding overhead.\n\nDedicated API libraries\nAs an example of a dedicated library, we use the {MODISTools} R package which queries remote sensing data generated by the MODIS remote sensing (satellite) mission from the Oak Ridge National Laboratories data archive. A full description of their API is provided online.\n\n# load the library\nlibrary(\"MODISTools\")\n\n# list all available products\n# (only showing first part of the table for brevity)\nMODISTools::mt_products() |> \n  head()\n\n       product\n1       Daymet\n2 ECO4ESIPTJPL\n3      ECO4WUE\n4       GEDI03\n5     GEDI04_B\n6      MCD12Q1\n                                                                         description\n1 Daily Surface Weather Data (Daymet) on a 1-km Grid for North America, Version 4 R1\n2               ECOSTRESS Evaporative Stress Index PT-JPL (ESI) Daily L4 Global 70 m\n3                          ECOSTRESS Water Use Efficiency (WUE) Daily L4 Global 70 m\n4                GEDI Gridded Land Surface Metrics (LSM) L3 1km EASE-Grid, Version 2\n5       GEDI Gridded Aboveground Biomass Density (AGBD) L4B 1km EASE-Grid, Version 2\n6              MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Cover Type (LC) Yearly L3 Global 500 m SIN Grid\n  frequency resolution_meters\n1     1 day              1000\n2    Varies                70\n3    Varies                70\n4  One time              1000\n5  One time              1000\n6    1 year               500\n\n# list bands for the MOD11A2\n# product (a land surface temperature product)\nMODISTools::mt_bands(\"MOD11A2\") |> \n  head()\n\n              band                          description valid_range fill_value\n1   Clear_sky_days               Day clear-sky coverage    1 to 255          0\n2 Clear_sky_nights             Night clear-sky coverage    1 to 255          0\n3    Day_view_angl View zenith angle of day observation    0 to 130        255\n4    Day_view_time        Local time of day observation    0 to 240        255\n5          Emis_31                   Band 31 emissivity    1 to 255          0\n6          Emis_32                   Band 32 emissivity    1 to 255          0\n   units scale_factor add_offset\n1   <NA>         <NA>       <NA>\n2   <NA>         <NA>       <NA>\n3 degree            1        -65\n4    hrs          0.1          0\n5   <NA>        0.002       0.49\n6   <NA>        0.002       0.49\n\n\nUsing this information we can now formulate a full query for use with the API.\n\n# download a demo dataset\n# specifying a location, a product,\n# a band (subset of the product)\n# and a date range and a geographic\n# area (1 km above/below and left/right).\n# Data is returned internally and the\n# progress bar of the download is not shown.\nsubset <- MODISTools::mt_subset(\n  product = \"MOD11A2\",\n  lat = 40,\n  lon = -110,\n  band = \"LST_Day_1km\",\n  start = \"2004-01-01\",\n  end = \"2004-02-01\",\n  km_lr = 1,\n  km_ab = 1,\n  internal = TRUE,\n  progress = FALSE\n)\n\n\n# print the dowloaded data\nhead(subset)\n\n      xllcorner  yllcorner         cellsize nrows ncols        band  units\n1.1 -9370963.05 4445948.79 926.625433055834     3     3 LST_Day_1km Kelvin\n2.1 -9370963.05 4445948.79 926.625433055834     3     3 LST_Day_1km Kelvin\n3.1 -9370963.05 4445948.79 926.625433055834     3     3 LST_Day_1km Kelvin\n4.1 -9370963.05 4445948.79 926.625433055834     3     3 LST_Day_1km Kelvin\n1.2 -9370963.05 4445948.79 926.625433055834     3     3 LST_Day_1km Kelvin\n2.2 -9370963.05 4445948.79 926.625433055834     3     3 LST_Day_1km Kelvin\n    scale latitude longitude     site product      start        end complete\n1.1  0.02       40      -110 sitename MOD11A2 2004-01-01 2004-02-01     TRUE\n2.1  0.02       40      -110 sitename MOD11A2 2004-01-01 2004-02-01     TRUE\n3.1  0.02       40      -110 sitename MOD11A2 2004-01-01 2004-02-01     TRUE\n4.1  0.02       40      -110 sitename MOD11A2 2004-01-01 2004-02-01     TRUE\n1.2  0.02       40      -110 sitename MOD11A2 2004-01-01 2004-02-01     TRUE\n2.2  0.02       40      -110 sitename MOD11A2 2004-01-01 2004-02-01     TRUE\n    modis_date calendar_date   tile     proc_date pixel value\n1.1   A2004001    2004-01-01 h09v05 2020168005635     1 13148\n2.1   A2004009    2004-01-09 h09v05 2020168010833     1 13160\n3.1   A2004017    2004-01-17 h09v05 2020168012220     1 13398\n4.1   A2004025    2004-01-25 h09v05 2020168013617     1 13412\n1.2   A2004001    2004-01-01 h09v05 2020168005635     2 13153\n2.2   A2004009    2004-01-09 h09v05 2020168010833     2 13140\n\n\nA detailed description of all functions of the MODISTools R package is beyond the scope of this course. However, the listed command show you what a dedicated API package does. It is a shortcut to functional elements of an API. For example mt_products() allows you to quickly list all products without any knowledge of an API URL. Although more complex, the mt_subset() routine allows you to query remote sensing data for a single location (specified with a latitude lat and longitude lon), and a given date range (e.g., start, end parameters), a physical extent (in km left-right and above-below).\n\n\nGET\nDepending on your data source, you will either need to rely on a dedicated R package to query the API or study the API documentation. The general scheme for using an API follows the use of the GET() command of the {httr} R library. You define a query using API parameters, as a named list, and then use a GET() statement to download the data from the endpoint (url).\n\n# formulate a named list query to pass to httr\nquery <- list(\n  \"argument\" = \"2\",\n  \"another_argument\" = \"3\"\n)\n\n# The URL of the API (varies per product / param)\nurl <- \"https://your.service.endpoint.com\"\n\n# download data using the\n# API endpoint and query data\n# status variable will include if\n# the download was successful or not\n# the write_disk() function captures\n# data if available and writes it to\n# disk\nstatus <- httr::GET(\n  url = url,\n  query = query,\n  httr::write_disk(\n    path = \"/where/to/store/data/filename.ext\",\n    overwrite = TRUE\n  )\n)\n\nBelow, we provide an example of using the GET command to download data from the Regridded Harmonized World Soil Database (v1.2) as hosted on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory computer infrastructure. In this case we download a subset of a global map of topsoil sand content (T_SAND).\n\n# set API URL endpoint\n# for the total sand content\nurl <- \"https://thredds.daac.ornl.gov/thredds/ncss/ornldaac/1247/T_SAND.nc4\"\n\n# formulate query to pass to httr\nquery <- list(\n  \"var\" = \"T_SAND\",\n  \"south\" = 32,\n  \"west\" = -81,\n  \"east\" = -80,\n  \"north\" = 34,\n  \"disableProjSubset\" = \"on\",\n  \"horizStride\" = 1,\n  \"accept\" = \"netcdf4\"\n)\n\n# download data using the\n# API endpoint and query data\nstatus <- httr::GET(\n  url = url,\n  query = query,\n  httr::write_disk(\n    path = file.path(tempdir(), \"T_SAND.nc\"),\n    overwrite = TRUE\n  )\n)\n\n# to visualize the data\n# we need to load the {terra}\n# library\nlibrary(\"terra\")\nsand <- terra::rast(file.path(tempdir(), \"T_SAND.nc\"))\nterra::plot(sand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication\nDepending on the API, authentication using a user name and a key or password is required. Then, the template should be slightly altered to accommodate for these requirements. Note that instead of the GET() command we use POST() as we need to post some authentication data before we can get the data in return.\n\n# an authenticated API query\nstatus <- httr::POST(\n  url = url,\n  httr::authenticate(user, key),\n  httr::add_headers(\"Accept\" = \"application/json\",\n                    \"Content-Type\" = \"application/json\"),\n  body = query,\n  encode = \"json\"\n)"

    "text": "3.1 The R geospatial ecosystem\nSpatiotemporal data often comes in the form of dense arrays, with space and time being array dimensions. Examples include\nsocio-economic or demographic data,\nenvironmental variables monitored at fixed stations,\nraster maps\ntime series of satellite images with multiple spectral bands,\nspatial simulations, and\nclimate or weather model output.\nThis R package provides classes and methods for reading, manipulating, plotting and writing such data cubes, to the extent that there are proper formats for doing so.\nA number of libraries (packages) make geo-computational work in R easy. However, the ecosystem has grown rapidly and therefore is continuously shifting. Unlike other processing environments this makes it at times hard to keep track of what to use when. Here I give a quick overview of the basic functionality and their uses cases of all these packages, finally there will be a brief overview of some basic geospatial operations using mostly terra and sf libraries (see Section 3.1.1 and Section 3.1.2). For a more extensive, deep dive, of all these packages I refer to Nowasad et al. (FIX REF).\n\n3.1.1 The terra package\nThe terra package is the successor of the older raster package, but with a simpler interface. This package deals with both geographic raster and vector data, with the explicit requirement that raster data represent spatially continuous processes on a fixed (rectangular) grid.\n\nReading and inspecting data\n\n# load the library\nlibrary(terra)\n\n# read data from file\nr <- terra::rast(\"demo_data.nc\")\n\nWe can inspect the meta data by calling the object, or we can visualize the data by plotting the data:\n\nprint(r)\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 41, 71, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 0.1, 0.1  (x, y)\nextent      : 4.95, 12.05, 43.95, 48.05  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : lon/lat WGS 84 \nsource      : demo_data.nc \nvarname     : t2m (2 metre temperature) \nname        : t2m \nunit        :   K \ntime        : 2022-01-01 12:00:00 UTC \n\nplot(r)\n\n\n\n\nDedicated functions exist to extract the layer names (names()) and the time stamps (time()) if there is a time component to the data.\n\nprint(time(r))\n\n[1] \"2022-01-01 12:00:00 UTC\"\n\nprint(names(r))\n\n[1] \"t2m\"\n\n\n\n\nBasic math\nBasic math or logical operations can be performed on maps using standard R notations. As shown above the data contains temperature data in Kelvin. You can convert this data from Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting 273.15 from all values in the data set.\n\n# conversion from Kelvin to C\nr_c <- r - 273.15\nplot(r_c)\n\n\n\n\nLogical operations work in the same way. You can create a mask of temperatures above 5C using a simple logical operation.\n\n# all locations above freezing\n# as a binary mask\nm <- r_c > 5\nplot(m)\n\n\n\n\nYou can exclude locations from calculations using masks. This is useful to restrict the region of interest of an analysis or limit edge cases of complex calculations beforehand. As an example you can mask out all values where the binary mask as generated above if FALSE (i.e. temperatures lower than 5C).\n\n# all locations above freezing\n# as a binary mask\nr_m <- terra::mask(r_c, m, maskvalue = FALSE)\nplot(r_m)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting and exporting data\nThe terra library uses pointers when referencing to data (in memory). This means that you can not save the object itself to resume your work later on. Saving the above masked map r_m using saveRDS(r_m, \"data.rds\") will only save a pointer to a memory space which will not exist when opening a new session. This is in contrast to for example operations on tabulated data (e.g. JSON, CSV files). As such, you need to save the output of your analysis using a formal geospatial data format using writeRaster().\nTo save masked temperature data in Celsius you would use:\n\n# save data to file\nterra::writeRaster(r_m, \"celsius_data_masked.tif\")\n\nAlternatively, but for small datasets only, you could convert the geospatial data to a long oriented data frame and save the data using standard methods to save tabulated data. However, you might loose critical meta-data on geographic projections etc. Using this method to save your work is not recommended unless you keep track of all ancillary meta-data separately.\n\n# convert geospatial data to a\n# data frame notation, where the flag\n# xy = TRUE denotes that pixel coordinate\n# details should be exported as well\ndf <- as.data.frame(r, xy = TRUE)\nhead(df)\n\n    x  y      t2m\n1 5.0 48 286.4682\n2 5.1 48 286.0754\n3 5.2 48 285.6437\n4 5.3 48 285.3351\n5 5.4 48 285.0714\n6 5.5 48 284.8469\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 The sf package\nSimple features are an open standard to store and access geographic data. The sf package provides a way to represent geospatial vector data as simple features in R. This results in nested data.frames or tibbles which adhere to the “tidy” data paradigm as previously described. They therefore are long oriented and support piped workflows on geometries. This standard reduces complexity and keeps geometry operations simple.\n\nReading and inspecting data\nA lot of GIS vector data comes as shapefiles (.shp extention). An example shapefile is include in the sf package, and we can read it using:\n\n# load library\nlibrary(sf)\n\n# load included shapefile\nnc <- st_read(system.file(\"shape/nc.shp\", package=\"sf\"))\n\nReading layer `nc' from data source \n  `/home/runner/.cache/R/renv/cache/v5/R-4.2/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/sf/1.0-12/5b41b4f0bd22b38661d82205a87deb4b/sf/shape/nc.shp' \n  using driver

For example, if we only want to retain Camden county from the data set we can use the filter() function as shown in Section 1.4.\n\n# subset data using the\n# tidy filter approach\ncamden <- nc |>\n    filter(\n        NAME == \"Camden\"\n    )\n\n# plot Camden county\nplot(camden)\n\nWarning: plotting the first 9 out of 14 attributes; use max.plot = 14 to plot\nall\n\n\n\n\n\nMost common operators vector data are area based logical operations. Such as taking the intersection or union of features, which only retains the outline of a polygon. These operations can be executed on features themselves or should be mediated by geometric binary operations which can be used for filtering the original data.\nFor example the st_intersection() function calculates where and how frequent simple features overlap (interesect) with each other.\n\n# calculate the intersection of all simple features\ni <- st_intersection(sf)\n\n# plot the intersections coloured\n# according to the number of overlaps\nplot(\n i[\"n.overlaps\"],\n main = \"number of intersections\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe results are again a tidy simple feature which can be sorted or filtered using the standard filter() function.\n\n# using the tidy data logic and the\n# filter function we can remove all\n# locations which only intersect with\n# itself (n.overlaps == 1)\ni <- i |>\n    filter(\n        n.overlaps > 1\n    )\n\nplot(\n i[\"n.overlaps\"],\n main = \"intersections with other features (n>1)\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nOther functions allow you to group overlapping features. For example grouping of intersecting features can be done using st_union(), which only returns the outermost boundary of a feature.\n\nu <- st_union(i)\nplot(u)\n\n\n\n\nThe sf package is relatively complex and for a full understanding of its components I refer to the package documentation and the book by Nowasad et al (REFERENCE).\n\n\nWriting and exporting data\nAlthough read in sf objects can be saved as internal R formats such as rds files using saveRDS(), for portability between various GIS software packages sf can write out a new shapefile using st_write().\n\n# write the north carolina data\n# to shapefile in the tempdir()\nsf::st_write(nc, file.path(tempdir(), \"nc.shp\"))\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 The stars package\nThe stars package is another geospatial R package you should take note of. In contrast to terra it is specifically tailored to dealing with data cubes. These are arrays of data on which on axis is time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Image by Edzer Pebesma\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the terra package the grid should not regular, but can of a different sort such as curvilinear data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Image by Edzer Pebesma\n\n\n\n\nSome other distinctions should be made, such as the fast summarizing of raster data to vector features. However, in most cases, it is best to explore functions within the terra package first before considering stars.\n\n\n3.1.4 Other noteworthy packages\nOther critical packages are ncdf4 which will be installed by default, but the included functions allow for the manipulation (reading and writing) of the common netCDF format. The rstac package which provides a convenient way to browse Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalogues (STAC), a format commonly used to organize remote sensing images online. The sits package which was created by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and provides tools for machine learning on data cubes.\nNote that R (or python for that matter) is infinitely flexible, and many packages exist to address niche problems within the context of geospatial data manipulation. Although often tapping into the power of the GDAL framework these packages are very powerful in their own right but outside the scope of this basic introduction. For more in depth discussion I refer to the list of resources at the end of this book."

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nLand surface phenology is a first order control on the exchange of water and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere. … As such it is an indicator of climate change. Plant phenology has historically been recorded for many centuries. More recently plant phenology (and its changes) have been recorded by networks of observers, near-surface cameras and not in the least by global satellite monitoring.\nAll these (remote sensing) measurements have provided us with insights in how climate change has altered plant phenology. Overall, climate change moves phenology forward (from spring toward winter) at a rate of 3 days/decade, with rates varying depending on locality and altitude.\nConsequences are many, such as exposing early blooming or leafing plants to increased frosts risks and carbon losses through an explicit opportunity cost. In short, changes to plant and land surface phenology have a profound effect on both the carbon balance and all (co-) dependent processes. Therefore, it is key that we can quantify how phenology changes in response to year-to-year variability and climate change and global heating.\nRemote sensing products provide these insights for almost four decades.
